# ASP.NET-WebApplication (2023)

## Description
The project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application designed to manage entities such as companies, addresses, and countries. It utilizes ASP.NET Core for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend, providing a dynamic user interface.

It uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability, and controllers to handle HTTP requests, perform actions using models, and return views or data.
Views are rendered using Razor syntax, with Vue.js handling most of the client-side rendering.

Application data are stored on SQL server and configured via Entity Framework Core with connection strings.

## Testing
Postman has been used for testing and documenting the API endpoints, ensuring they function correctly and handle edge cases.
